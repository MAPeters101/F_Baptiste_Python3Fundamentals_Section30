Question 4
Using the same dataframe as the preceding questions, write a function that
returns a single dataframe containing the record(s) with maximum high-low
spread for each symbol in the dataframe. (Do not hardcode symbol names in this
function - instead you should recover the possible symbol names from the data
itself).

The returned dataframe should have the same structure as the original
dataframe, but just contain the rows of maximum high-low spread for each symbol.
